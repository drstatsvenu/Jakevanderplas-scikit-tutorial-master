# Jakevanderplas-scikit-tutorial
Jakevanderplas scikit tutorial on youtube is inarguably best tutorial for machine learning using scikit learn. But this tutorial doesn't give you the mathematical background that is making the algorithm work. This repository is what I practiced and not exactly a tutorial but I hope this helps you.
